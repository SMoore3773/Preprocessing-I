      <h2>About Homer</h2>
      <p class = 'mcbDes'>I'm Homer, hard working family man and sometimes grifter and entrepreneur. I have a loving wife, Marge, and three children. The daughters (Lisa and Maggie) are good, and the boy... well, he's Bart. I like to drink Duff and enjoy Lard Lad donuts. I am also SMRT certified.</p>

      <h2>What Homer Can Do</h2>
      <p class = 'mcbDes'>It would be easier to list what Homer can't do. Homer is a father and a provider. Homer has won a Grammy, an Academy Award, a Pulitzer Prize, I've been in space, and saved the town more times than I can count!</p>

      <h2>Where Homer Works</h2>
      <p class = 'mcbDes'>Homer works as a safety inspector at a nuclear power plant as my day job, but I also moonlight as the driver of Mr. Plow, the manager of country music star Lurleen Lumpkin, and astronaut.</p>

      <h2>Call Homer</h2>
      <p class = 'mcbDes'>Don't hesitate to call Homer! If you can't reach me at the house phone, call Moe's Tavern, just don't expect a quick response. If I'm not there, try Barney's Bowlorama Bowling Alley (where I bowled a perfect game!). If I'm not there either, I'm probably at work. You'll have to leave a message, because I'll be busy napping.</p>
